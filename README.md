# Neural-Networks
MSc Machine Learning module coursework to create a Neural Network library and implementing a forward model and region of interest using TensorFlow 

To run question 2 evaluating architecture uncomment the evaluate_architecture() line in the main() function. The optional parameters are exaplined in the code. 

To run question 2 predict hidden, uncomment the predict_hidden() line in the main() function. Change the file path to your dataset file path.

To run the predict_hidden function in learn_ROI.py, run the below command, replacing <dataset_name> with the filename of the dataset:

python3 learn_ROI.py <dataset_name>

This returns the output predictions to the 'predictions' variable, and prints the classification report of the model's predictions.
